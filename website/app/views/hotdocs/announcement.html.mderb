# HotDocs: Announcement Bar

An announcement, like the one at the top of this page, can be configured as follows:

```erb
<%%= content_for(:announcement, '<div class="announcement">Demo announcement ðŸŽ‰</div>'.html_safe) %>
```

Or in `hotdocs_helper.rb` like:

```erb
<%%= content_for(:announcement) do %>
  <div class="announcement">Demo announcement ðŸŽ‰</div>
<%% end %>
```
