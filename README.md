## Demo

HotDocs uses itself for its docs: [check the demo out](https://hotdocsrails.com).

## Development

In its current state, HotDocs is a mountable Rails engine.

The HotDocs website is a Rails app configured to use the HotDocs engine. Run it with:

```bash
bin/dev
bin/rails test
```

To release a new version:
- Update the version number in `version.rb`
- Run `bundle exec rake release`, which will
  - Create a git tag for the version
  - Push git commits and the created tag
  - Push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org)
